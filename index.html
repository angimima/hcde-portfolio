<p>Hi Everyone! My name is Angie and I'm a 1st year, full-time HCDE MS student. 
I currently work part-time wrangling UW Libraries websites and digital projects. 
I'm proficient in HTML/CSS and took PHP classes many years ago. 
I'm taking this class to move from being a scripting hack to actually knowing what I'm doing.</p>
